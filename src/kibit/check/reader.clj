;; Preprocessing
;; -------------
;; Alias pre-processing

;; It is necessary at read time to maintain a small amount of state
;; about the contents of the stream read so far to enable the proper
;; reading of aliased keywords. Clojure accomplishes this during
;; `(:require ...)` because evaluation and compilation is interlaced
;; with reading so as to establish aliases in a namespace as it is
;; being loaded. To do this statically we need to maintain a temporary
;; table of namespaces to aliases. Additionally, we cannot simply use
;; a map of aliases as it is possible to switch namespaces mid-file
;; and get one stream to effectively hop between two namespaces.
